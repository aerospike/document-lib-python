API
===

Although the ``DocumentClient`` is implemented in the ``api`` module,
``api`` is not meant to be imported directly because it contains helper functions.
Please import ``DocumentClient`` from the ``documentapi`` package as shown in the cookbook.

.. autoclass:: documentapi.api.DocumentClient
    :members:

.. automodule:: documentapi.exception
